<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover:About the project

Pikombucha is entirely a frontend application using React, designed to provide a seamless and responsive user experience without relying on a backend server. This approach ensures quick loading times and smooth interactions, leveraging modern frontend technologies to deliver content and functionality directly to your browser.

It is a frontend application developed using React to serve as an MVP for a product proposal that allows beverage management on the administrative area of the website. This was the MVP for the Advanced Frontend Sprint at PUC-RJ, and CRUD functionalities were added to allow adding, editing, removing, and viewing products, becoming part of the MVP for the Advanced Backend Sprint along with a REST API that saves address data in an SQLite database. The API is available in the [reposit√≥rio](https://github.com/ANNEBORTOLI/api-puc-mvp-sprint-backend-avancado)..

On the cart page, it is possible to check postal codes using the external VIACEP API to simulate a delivery fee for the products.

The product query and database addition functionalities work without a backend, using a JSON file to load the necessary information, simulating a backend request (this was implemented in the Advanced Frontend Sprint).
